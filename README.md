# SetUpon
An interactive annotating image sharing / social media platform based around sharing home office and gaming setups. This was a school project for Cloud Computing where we had to create something that utilizes AWS cloud services.

> ⚠️ Note: As of right now, because the AWS services were funded by credit supplied by the school, the app is pretty much non-functional at the moment. It will be set back up in the future [through some other way](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) to simulate the architecture of the backend.

Here was a preview of a really early version of it:
